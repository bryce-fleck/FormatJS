React Intl Hello World Example
==============================

This is a very simple — yet runnable app — showing how to use React Intl to format message (string) that contains a placeholder, plural, and number.

## Running

**You first need to build the main React Intl library:**

```
$ cd ../..
$ npm run build
$ cd examples/hello-world/
```

Then you can run this example:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
